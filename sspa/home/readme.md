Scaffold the boilerplate with `pnpx create-single-spa --moduleType app-parcel` and the options:

```bash
? Directory for new project home
? Which framework do you want to use? react
? Which package manager do you want to use? pnpm
? Will this project use Typescript? Yes
? Organization name (can use letters, numbers, dash or underscore) tuco
? Project name (can use letters, numbers, dash or underscore) homePage
```

1. Run `pnpm start -- --port 8500`
2. Go to http://single-spa-playground.org/playground/instant-test?name=@tuco/homePage&url=8500 to see it working
